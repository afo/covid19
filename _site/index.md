## Course description
The Learn 2 Launch Blockchain class aims to equip all students with a deep insight into Blockchain technology, its capabilities, and  to seperate hype from reality. This is an applied overview course, where we will explain how Blockchain technology works, how to actually apply it to solve problems.

Lectures will be split up in two parts, the first will be a lecture highlighting a topic related to blockchain technology and the second part will consist of student presentations, assignment check up, and project mentoring / feedback. 

We'll have guest lectures from industry and academia, as well as hands-on group exercises and presentation of use cases will help along the way.
