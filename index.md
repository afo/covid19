### Description

[covid19nordics.se](covid19nordics.se) is an open source dashboard to visualize Covid-19 related data for the Nordic countries, including reported cases, deaths, mobility data, timeline of political decisions.

The data is presented in dynamic graphs and maps which are easy to overview and understand even for a layman. Time stamps for data points and events are available and can be adjusted. The information can be used to analyse the effect of political actions done by a country. Mobility data shows how travel habits have evolved during the crisis, per day and region.

Individuals can see mobility trends, confirmed cases and deaths in their region and how it evolves over time. Based on the assumption that less mobility leads to less virus spread and deaths, this data can have a positive impact if people reduce their mobility and social interactions.

Decision makers can get an easy overview of the status in their country as well as other countries. They can base their decisions on the most recent and reliable data.


The Nordic countries are not testing broadly, therefore the recorded number of deaths is a more reliable measure to use in order to assess the impact of the disease in each country.

It's interesting to track the developments because these countries are very similar, but they have implemented very different mitigation strategies -- see e.g.: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html)

The plots are updated every 30mins with the most recent data.
