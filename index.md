### Description
Simple analysis of the covid19 development in the Nordic countries. Since the Nordic countries are not testing broadly the recorded number of deaths is a more reliable measure of the impact of the disease in each country.

The most relevant plot to track the development is **Deaths per day since first death per Mn inhabitants**.

The plots are updated daily at 9pm (24hr lag from the data source).
