### Description
Simple analysis of the COVID-19 situation in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland).

The Nordic countries are not testing broadly, therefore the recorded number of deaths is a more reliable measure to use in order to assess the impact of the disease in each country.

It's interesting to track the developments because these countries are very similar, but they have implemented very different mitigation strategies -- see eg: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus.html)

The most relevant plot is **4. Total Deaths per Mn inhabitants, daily figures since day of first death**.

The plots are updated daily at 5AM CET (5hr date lag).
